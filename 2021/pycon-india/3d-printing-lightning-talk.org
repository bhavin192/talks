*** Our own RepRap printer

* How do they work?

** Building the object layer by layer

   * FFF (FDM): [[https://wiki.reprap.org/wiki/FFF][Fused Filament Fabrication]]

   * SLA: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography][Stereolithography]]

* Why build own?

   * Might be slightly cheaper.

   * Freedom.

   * Control.

** The RepRap project

   * Replicating Rapid Prototyper

   * Adrian Bowyer

   * Community project ([[https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap][RepRap.org]])

* Where is Python?

   In most of the popular Free Software project involved

** The projects

   * [[https://freecadweb.org/][FreeCAD]]: 3D modeling software.

   * [[https://www.pronterface.com/][Pronterface]]: Host software.

   * [[https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura][Ultimaker Cura]]: Slicing software.

   * And many more.

* Was it a success?

   YES! We got the printer working.
