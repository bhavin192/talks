* Microservices?
  - Treating services as products
  - More easy to manage
  - What about debugging things?
** 
   [[file:microservices.svg]]
* Monitoring
  Is the service working?

  Let's keep checking for that
** Up for Microservices?
   They are never 100% up
** 
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Nines don’t matter if users aren’t happy.

   #+END_QUOTE
* Observability
  Being able to get view of system

  Helps to understand your system
** 
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Stop reverse engineering applications and start monitoring from the inside.

     —[[https://vimeo.com/173610242][Kelsey Hightower, Monitorama 2016]]
   #+END_QUOTE
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   Instrumentation is done to achieve this
   #+END_NOTES
** Pillars of Observability
   - Logging
   - Metrics monitoring
   - Tracing
** Logging
   Events, errors occurred in applications
   
   The limits of logging
   
   Signal to noise ratio
   
   Serve for problems predicted in advanced
   
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   - Logs are hard to scale when there are more number or requests are
     coming in.
   - Log aggregation pipeline becomes bottleneck for scaling as well.
   #+END_NOTES
** Metrics monitoring
   Numerical information about what's happening

   Help to predict the behavior
** Tracing
   Path taken by an user's request

   Connecting individual components
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   - When all the microservices are dependent, getting the call tree
   - Solving cascading failures
   - Individual component metrics/logs say that everything is fine but
     there is still some latency
   #+END_NOTES
** Tracing in Serverless/FaaS
   # TODO: add details here
* Introducing GaS
  /Greetings as Service/
  - Frontend
  - Two Functions
    - Greeter
    - Image
  - Using Kafka in between
** Components of GaS
   [[file:gas_architecture.svg]]
** 
   [[file:gas_architecture_1.jpg]]
* Functions on Kubernetes
  - Fission
  - Kubernetes native
  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  - Fission is completely Kubernetes aware, uses CRDs etc
  #+END_NOTES
** Fission functions
   - Function code
   - One entry point
** Fission function environments
   - Container images
   - Available for most of the languages
   - Extensible
** Function trigger
   - Actions to invoke function execution
   - Supports HTTP and message queues
**

** Tracing backends
   - Collecting the trace events called spans
   - Storing as well as visualization of those events
** How to collect these events?
   - Instrumenting your code
   - Client libraries built according to OpenTracing standards
* Let's trace things
  - Instrumenting each function's code?
  - Environments to the rescue
* Modifying the Python environment
  - Uses Flask as HTTP server
  - ~server.py~ loads user defined functions
  - Directory structure

   - When environment Pods run they don't have function code in them
   - ~/specialize~ is called so that code mounted inside Pod is

   #+END_SRC
* Visualization in Jaeger
  - Spans are not linked together
  - [[file:faas-tracing-1.mp4]]
** 
   Spans of greeter function

   [[file:greeter_single_span.png]]
** 
   Spans of image function

   [[file:image_single_span.png]]
* Linking spans together
  - Context propagation
  - Passing context over the wire
# TODO: add a block diagram here; should show the flow of inject and
# extract operations
** ~extract~ operation
   1. Incoming request to the function
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      …
      trace-id: 1234abcd
      #+END_EXAMPLE
   2. Create object of span context using ~tracer.extract()~
   3. Start a new span with span context as parent
      ~tracer.start_span()~
# Should add image here?
** ~inject~ operation
   4. Create headers for further requests made by user code
      ~tracer.inject()~
   5. Save the current span and new headers in Flask's global ~g~
** Context propagation in ~tracing.py~
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   def inner():
       …
       span_ctx = tracer.extract(Format.HTTP_HEADERS, request.headers)
       with tracer.start_span(span_name, child_of=span_ctx) as span:
           …
	   generated_headers = dict()
	   tracer.inject(span, Format.HTTP_HEADERS, generated_headers)
	   # User may want to set tags on span or use the generated_headers
	   g.span = span
	   g.generated_headers = generated_headers
           …
           func_resp = func()
       return func_resp
   #+END_SRC
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   - Using Flask's global oject g so that users can leverage the
     instrumented code
     - Setting tags
     - Creating child spans etc
   #+END_NOTES
** Modifying Kafka MQT of Fission
   /More about MQT of Fission/
   - New records are sent as HTTP request to functions
   - No support for Kafka record headers
# TODO: image of MQT to HTTP request workflow
** 
   [[file:kafka_header_support_full_image.png]]
** Running the service again
   [[file:linked_spans.png]]
** 
   [[file:trace_graph_child_of.png]]
* Wrong timestamps on spans
  - ClockSkew adjustments
  - Using ~FOLLOWS_FROM~ reference instead CHILD_OF
# TODO: image of gantt chart showing child_of;
# https://opentracing.io/specification/#the-opentracing-data-model
** Adding support for references in ~jaeger-client-python~
   [[file:jaeger-client-python-references-support.png]]
** Modified ~tracing.py~
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
     span_ctx = tracer.extract(Format.HTTP_HEADERS, request.headers)
     # passing it as reference instead of child_of relation as we
     # have async calls to services
     span_reference = follows_from(referenced_context=span_ctx)
     with tracer.start_span(span_name, references=span_reference) as span:
         …
	 return response
   #+END_SRC

* 
  ~tracer.close()~ from ~jaeger-client-python~
  - Spans are submitted asynchronously
  - ~tracer.close()~ is not fully synchronous
  - [[https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python/issues/229#issuecomment-451363106][#229 (comment)]], [[https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python/issues/50#issuecomment-394922333][#50 (comment)]]
* Watch out for these
  - We may encounter duplicate trace Ids
    - Use 128bit trace Ids ([[https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python/pull/230][PR#230]])
  - While working with asynchronous applications use ~FOLLOWS_FROM~
    reference
  - Using TCP or HTTP to send the tracing events instead of UDP
  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  - These are some of the things you might want to consider while
    implementing similar setup in other platforms
