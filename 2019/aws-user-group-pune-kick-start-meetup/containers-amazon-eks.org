* Containers? Kubernetes?
  - Isolated processes along with dependencies
  - Production ready container orchestration
* Kubernetes components

** Master plane
   - kube-controller-manager
   - kube-apiserver
   - kube-scheduler
   - cloud-controller-manager
   - etcd cluster
** Worker plane
   - kube-proxy
   - kubelet
* Running Kubernetes on AWS

* Managed vs self hosted
  - Cost
  - Scaling of master plane components
  - Managing etcd
  - Security updates
  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  - Fixed cost of master plane with $144 per month, can scale with
    increasing number of worker nodes.
  - Self hosted needs to run on something like c4.large with minimum 3
    nodes, costs more than $250 per month. Cost increases as number of
    worker nodes increase due to need to increase in master nodes as
    well
  - Backup, replication, HA of etcd
  #+END_NOTES
* Introducing EKS
* Features
  - Vanilla Kubernetes setup
  - [[https://landscape.cncf.io/category=certified-kubernetes-hosted&format=card-mode&grouping=category&selected=amazon-elastic-container-service-for-kubernetes-eks][Certified Kubernetes Solution]]
** Runs on AWS services
   - EC2 as worker nodes
   - ASG for worker node groups
   - Security Groups
   - [[https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/][Amazon Elastic Container Registry]] (ECR)
** Networking solution
   - [[https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s/][amazon-vpc-cni-k8s]]
   - Assigns IP addresses from Subnet directly to Pods
   - Uses Calico for NetworkPolicy implementation
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   - Attaches ENIs to the instances and assigns IPs from that
   #+END_NOTES
** Audit logs to CloudWatch
   - Shipping logs from Kubernetes master components to CloudWatch

* Do watch out for
  - Creating your own AMI ([[https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami][awslabs/amazon-eks-ami]])
  - No out of the box support for Prometheus metrics
  - IAM access segregation at Pod level is not present ([[https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/23][Issue #23]])
  - Updating worker nodes needs some more efforts
  - ASG is not aware about draining nodes before killing/terminating
    them
  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  - Kiam can be a solution here https://github.com/uswitch/kiam
  - Need to drain worker nodes, update stuff then also update the
    aws-node DaemonSet etc
  - EC2 ASG features like re-balancing nodes can terminate instances
